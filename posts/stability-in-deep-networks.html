        <h1>Dynamical Systems Theory and Neural Networks</h1>

        <p>
          At first glance, neural networks belong to computer science while dynamical systems
          theory belongs to mathematics and physics. Yet at a deeper level, they speak the same
          language: the evolution of states under repeated transformation. Once this connection
          is made explicit, many phenomena in deep learning—training stability, exploding
          gradients, attractors, memory, and even expressivity—can be reinterpreted through the
          lens of nonlinear dynamics.
        </p>

        <p>
          A dynamical system, in its simplest discrete form, is defined by an iteration
        </p>

        <p>
          \[
            x_{t+1} = F(x_t),
          \]
        </p>

        <p>
          where \(x_t \in \mathbb{R}^n\) is the state at time \(t\), and \(F\) is a nonlinear map.
          A feedforward neural network with \(L\) layers is structurally identical to such an
          iteration. If we denote activations by \(h_\ell\), weights by \(W_\ell\), biases by
          \(b_\ell\), and nonlinearities by \(\sigma\), then each layer obeys
        </p>

        <p>
          \[
            h_{\ell+1} = \sigma(W_\ell h_\ell + b_\ell).
          \]
        </p>

        <p>
          Depth is therefore discrete time. A deep network is a finite-time trajectory of a
          nonlinear dynamical system in activation space.
        </p>

        <p>
          This viewpoint becomes even more literal in recurrent neural networks, where the same
          transformation is applied repeatedly:
        </p>

        <p>
          \[
            h_{t+1} = \sigma(W h_t + U x_t + b).
          \]
        </p>

        <p>
          Here, the hidden state evolves exactly like a nonlinear dynamical system driven by an
          input signal \(x_t\). Questions about memory reduce to questions about stability of
          trajectories and persistence of information in the state.
        </p>

        <h2>Fixed Points, Attractors, and Representation</h2>

        <p>
          In dynamical systems theory, a fixed point satisfies
        </p>

        <p>
          \[
            x^* = F(x^*).
          \]
        </p>

        <p>
          Stability is determined by the Jacobian \(DF(x^*)\). If all eigenvalues satisfy
          \(|\lambda_i| < 1\), the fixed point is locally attracting. In neural networks,
          similar reasoning governs signal propagation. Consider a deep linear network where
          \(h_{\ell+1} = W h_\ell\). Then
        </p>

        <p>
          \[
            h_L = W^L h_0.
          \]
        </p>

        <p>
          The eigenvalues of \(W\) determine whether activations vanish, explode, or remain
          stable as depth increases. The same spectral radius condition that appears in
          stability theory appears in deep learning under the name of exploding and vanishing
          gradients.
        </p>

        <p>
          Even nonlinear networks can be analyzed by linearizing around trajectories. If we
          perturb a state \(h_\ell \to h_\ell + \delta h_\ell\), then to first order
        </p>

        <p>
          \[
            \delta h_{\ell+1}
            =
            D\sigma(W_\ell h_\ell + b_\ell) \, W_\ell \, \delta h_\ell.
          \]
        </p>

        <p>
          The product of these Jacobians across layers determines gradient flow during
          backpropagation. From a dynamical perspective, training stability is governed by the
          Lyapunov exponents of this multiplicative process.
        </p>

        <h2>Continuous Depth and Neural ODEs</h2>

        <p>
          When the number of layers becomes large and each transformation becomes small, the
          discrete iteration approaches a differential equation. If we write
        </p>

        <p>
          \[
            h_{\ell+1} = h_\ell + \Delta t \, f(h_\ell, \theta_\ell),
          \]
        </p>

        <p>
          and take the limit \(\Delta t \to 0\), we obtain
        </p>

        <p>
          \[
            \frac{dh(t)}{dt} = f(h(t), \theta(t)).
          \]
        </p>

        <p>
          This is the foundation of neural ordinary differential equations. The network is no
          longer a stack of layers but a flow in state space. Expressivity corresponds to the
          geometry of this flow, and training corresponds to adjusting the vector field
          \(f\).
        </p>

        <p>
          In this setting, concepts such as trajectories, invariant manifolds, and attractors
          become literal geometric objects shaping representation learning.
        </p>

        <h2>Loss Landscapes as Gradient Flows</h2>

        <p>
          Training itself is another dynamical system, this time in parameter space. Gradient
          descent follows
        </p>

        <p>
          \[
            \theta_{k+1} = \theta_k - \eta \nabla_\theta \mathcal{L}(\theta_k).
          \]
        </p>

        <p>
          In continuous time, this becomes the gradient flow equation
        </p>

        <p>
          \[
            \frac{d\theta}{dt} = - \nabla_\theta \mathcal{L}(\theta).
          \]
        </p>

        <p>
          Critical points satisfy \(\nabla_\theta \mathcal{L} = 0\). Their stability depends on
          the Hessian \(H = \nabla^2_\theta \mathcal{L}\). If the eigenvalues of \(H\) are
          positive, the point is locally attracting; if some are negative, it is a saddle.
          Modern optimization theory in deep learning can therefore be interpreted as studying
          high-dimensional nonlinear flows.
        </p>

        <p>
          Generalization properties are often connected to the geometry of these flows, such as
          flat versus sharp minima, which correspond to different stability characteristics of
          the dynamical system in parameter space.
        </p>

        <h2>Chaos, Expressivity, and Complexity</h2>

        <p>
          Nonlinear dynamical systems can exhibit chaos when small perturbations grow
          exponentially. In neural networks, similar sensitivity can increase expressivity but
          harm trainability. If the product of Jacobians has singular values that grow
          exponentially with depth, information becomes unstable. If they decay, information
          disappears.
        </p>

        <p>
          Thus, initialization schemes and normalization techniques can be understood as
          mechanisms for placing the network near a critical regime where dynamics are neither
          too contractive nor too expansive. In that narrow band, signals propagate without
          collapse, and gradients remain usable.
        </p>

        <h2>Closing Perspective</h2>

        <p>
          Neural networks are not merely function approximators. They are dynamical systems in
          activation space during inference and dynamical systems in parameter space during
          training. Stability theory explains gradient behavior. Spectral analysis explains
          depth scaling. Continuous limits lead to differential equations. Even phenomena such
          as memory, attractors, and chaos translate directly between the two fields.
        </p>

        <p>
          Viewing deep learning through dynamical systems theory does more than provide elegant
          mathematics. It offers structural insight into why certain architectures work, why
          others fail, and how geometry governs learning in high dimensions.
