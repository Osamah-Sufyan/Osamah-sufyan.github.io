        <h1>Designing for Focus in a Distracted Web</h1>
        <p>
          The modern web rewards loudness. Every card flashes, every button begs,
          and every product wants to be memorable in ten seconds. But the products
          that stay useful for years are often the quiet ones.
        </p>
        <p>
          My rule is simple: emphasize one core action per screen, then remove
          everything that competes with it. Visual interest comes from spacing,
          rhythm, and a tight color system, not clutter.
        </p>
        <p>
          Focus is a design choice and a product strategy. If users can complete a
          task without friction, they return. If they feel overloaded, they leave.
